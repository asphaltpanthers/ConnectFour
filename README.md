# ConnectFour

This is a port of Bill Laboon's ConnectFour application written in ruby to java. This application has been left with bugs intentionally as an exercise for students to write test plans and find defects in the application.

To run the program, first build it.

```
javac ConnectFour.java
```

You can then either run it from Eclipse or open the bin directory and execute the following command:

```
java ConnectFour <parameter>
java ConnectFour 7
```
